              <h6>Stephen Ray Leslie is an American singer-songwriter based in Bellingham, WA.<br>
              <br>
              While at WWU, his musical direction veered toward traditional Americana as he explored his musical roots in the works of artists such as Van Zandt, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson and Hank Williams. Around this time, Leslie switched to guitar and began crafting songs in the vein of his musical heroes.<br>
              <br>
              As members began having children and moving out of state, Chuckanut Drive disbanded around 2010, but Leslie continued writing songs and performing. Leslie has shared the stage with Americana heavyweights such as Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson, Lukas Nelson, the late Justin Townes Earle, and Fred Eaglesmith, to name a few.<br>
              <br>
              Today, Leslie continues writing and performing and is currently writing and recording his first full-length solo release.

"I write from the heart and I really think about what I'm writing," he notes. "There's a real ebb and flow to the process. For the past few years I've spent the summers on fishing boats in Alaska, and when I don't have cell service and I'm really off the grid I have a lot of time to think. It is when the creative process really gets rolling." McHugh's songs come from a deeply personal perspective; clean, honest and dripping with truth.</h6>
