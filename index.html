              <h6>My first memories of life originate in Brooklyn, New York, and by the time I was ten years old, we had moved back and forth across the country 3 times. I have been a traveler for most of my life, and I suppose my songs are somewhat informed by the diversity of places and people I have experienced. I came to the Skagit Valley after spending nine years as part of the rich, diverse songwriting community in East Nashville, Tennessee. In that time I gained the widespread respect of my peers, and had the opportunity to play in a lot of the most beloved music venues in town. If you are a fan of soulful, intelligent, lyric driven songs, come out!</h6>
