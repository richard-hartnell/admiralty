Bates draws on her turbulent past, using songwriting to navigate the dark struggles that shape her art. Boasting powerhouse vocals and dynamic highs and lows, Brooke Bates is a one stop shop.<br>
<br>
Classically trained and vocally heavy, she dips and soars through a three-octave range. Her debut single "Complicated" reels with multifaceted emotions influenced by varying degrees of relationships. Like much of her songwriting, it highlights internal struggles, seldom spoken.<br>

"I write from the heart and I really think about what I'm writing," he notes. "There's a real ebb and flow to the process. For the past few years I've spent the summers on fishing boats in Alaska, and when I don't have cell service and I'm really off the grid I have a lot of time to think. It is when the creative process really gets rolling." McHugh's songs come from a deeply personal perspective; clean, honest and dripping with truth.</h6>
