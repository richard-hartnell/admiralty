For Chef Jeremiah, there is no rule above the mandate to make our offerings as delicious as possible, and if that leads to unconventional places, all the better! We are so lucky tp have him and hope you'll come try his offerings soon!</figcaption>

As many of you have already learned, Kat is that and much more; a veritable point of intersection on the paths of excellence and sass. Many of the menus favorites are her creation: The Cork Leg, The Wellerman, Dogfish Catfight and more leap from her mind to your glass. If you haven't had a chance to say hello, we'd say there's no time like the present!</figcaption>

              <h2>Octavia McAloon</h2>
              <h6>Octavia  McAloon is a captivating singer-songwriter and classical musician based  in Bellingham, WA.  With intricate fingerpicking and velvety vocals, she weaves together songs that draw listeners in.

Stylistically, Octavia works towards  bridging the gap between her folk and classical backgrounds; the music she produces is always steeped in vocal  harmonies and atmospheric textures.  In live performance, she lets the intimate pairing of guitar and eloquent lyrics take the lead.<br>
                <br>
                Octavia's debut album, <em>With Breath of Wind</em>, was released in April 2020 and is available on all streaming platforms. Her sophomore album Skybound is a concept album in the style of a folk-opera and releases everywhere January 13th, 2023.
