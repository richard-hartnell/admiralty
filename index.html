              <h2>Ludlings</h2>
              <h6>Indie-rock/pop/folk band Ludlings formed in Bellingham in 2018 when Ariel and Van met as the result of a very fortuitous Craigslist posting. Following the bringing on of Walker on drums, the trio quickly began recording and playing shows throughout Whatcom and Skagit county for the next year and a half.<br>
                <br>
                Despite the group eventually moving to all different parts of the world and Walker eventually moving on, Ariel and Van continued to play and record together remotely, eventually releasing “Old Feelings”, their debut album with the collaboration and support from family and friends along the way.</h6>
